# 🐢 Turtle Crossing Game

A fun arcade-style game built with Python's Turtle Graphics module. Your goal is to help the turtle cross a busy road without getting hit by cars! The game gets harder with each level as car speed increases.

## 🎮 How to Play

- Reach the top of the screen to level up.
- Avoid getting hit by the cars — if you collide, it's game over!

## 🚀 Features

- Scoreboard to track your progress
- Smooth animation using `tracer()` and `update()`
- Object-oriented design with classes:
  - `Player`
  - `CarManager`
  - `Scoreboard`
